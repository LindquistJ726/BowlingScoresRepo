# BowlingScoresRepo
This Repo is to show a program I worked on in my C++ class at Macomb Community College. This program means a little bit more to me than most because of how bad I originally struggled with it. The finished program will take a name and 5 bowling scores from a text file and put them into a structure, functions will use the structure to average out the scores and then print them.
