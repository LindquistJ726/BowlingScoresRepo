# BowlingScoresRepo
This is a program I worked on in my C++ class at Macomb Community College. This program means a little bit more to me than other because of how badly i struggled with it initially. With the help of my professor i understood what my program was doing wrong and with the example that was given to me i was able to fix it. This program will take 10 different names and 5 cooresponding scores per name from a text file, the program will put this data into a structure and use functions to average and print that data. The program was originally used for bowling but with a couple slight changes in the words you can use it for most sports.
